 # Heapsort by Using Max Heap
 
 **Implementation of Max Heap and Heapsort**

 **Requirments**: Please refer to the section *Heaps* of *Chapter 5* to construct a max heap for a given sequence of unsorted numbers. After the construction of **max heap**, please implement a **heapsort** by using the constructed max heap, with reference to the heapsort algorithm mentioned in *Chapter 6*.

 **Input**: A sequence of unsorted numbers, such as: 16, 7, 22, 19, and 12.
 
 **Graphical Interface Instructions**:
 
 - Type in a sequence of integers in the *Text Field*. The inputs should be separated by space. Invalid inputs are be omitted.
 
 - The upper *Gray Area* shows the real-time status of the heap, represented as an array.
 
 - The lower *Gray Area* shows the sorted array dynamicly in real-time.
 
 Perss "Next Step" button to sort the array step by step. If the input array is empty, or is fully sorted, the "Next Step" button will be disabled.
 Note that you can input another array only when the previous array is fully sorted.
