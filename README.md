# Max Heap-sort Visulized Using SwiftUI
 
 **Implementation of Max Heap and Heapsort**

 **Requirments:** Please refer to the section "Heaps" of *Chapter 5* to construct a max heap for a given sequence of unsorted numbers. After the construction of **max heap**, please implement a **heapsort** by using the constructed max heap, with reference to the heapsort algorithm mentioned in *Chapter 6*.

 **Input**: A sequence of unsorted numbers, such as: 16, 7, 22, 19, and 12.
 
 **Graphical Interface Instructions**:
 
 - Type in a sequence of integers in the *Text Field*. The inputs should be separated by space. Invalid inputs will be omitted.
 
 - The upper *Gray Area* shows the real-time status of the max heap, represented in array.
 
 - The lower *Gray Area* shows the sorted array dynamicly in real-time.
 
 Perss "Next Step" button to sort the array step by step. If the input array is empty, or is fully sorted, the "Next Step" button will be disabled.
 You can input another array of integers when the previous array is fully sorted.
